About me
======
Hi, I am currently a fourth-year PhD student at [National Laboratotry of Pattern Recognition](http://nlpr-web.ia.ac.cn/cn/index.html)(NLPR), [Institute of Automation](http://www.ia.cas.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences(CASIA), under the supervision of [Qiulei Dong](http://vision.ia.ac.cn/Faculty/qldong/index.htm). Previously, I received my B.Eng degree in communication engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2017. Here are my CV [CN](https://ds0529.github.io/files/ShuangDengCV-CN.pdf).

My current research interests generally focus on 3D point cloud semantic segmentation and measuring relative poses of satellites.

Personal
======
I have broad interests in reading about philosophy/history/economics.<br/>
I also love travelling, hiking and many other outdoor activities. Some recent travelling photos are shared below.<br/>
